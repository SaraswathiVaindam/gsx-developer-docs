# Introduction

The `UGIX Auth Consumer APIs` allows a `consumer` to request and obtain tokens to access `open` and `secure` resources. Access information related to a resource can be understood via the [Consumer Panel](https://catalogue.ugix.org.in/consumer)

## Registration

A new consumer can register with an account when prompted to log-in at the [Catalogue Panel](https://catalogue.ugix.org.in) or at the [Consumer Panel](https://catalogue.ugix.org.in/consumer). Go to [Registration](../registration.md) for instructions on registering.

Once a consumer registers, **they will be able to log into the Catalogue Panel and the Consumer Panel**. They can also obtain access tokens for data access via `APIs`.
