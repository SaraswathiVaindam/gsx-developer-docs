# Introduction

The UGIX Provider APIs empower providers to manage access to their secure resources through the [Publisher Panel](https://catalogue.ugix.org.in/provider).

## Registration and Provider Approval

The UGIX Administration team initiates the provider registration process by creating an entry for the provider's organization. New providers can register for an account by logging in at the [Publisher Panel](https://catalogue.ugix.org.in/provider). For detailed instructions on registering, please refer to the [Registration](../registration.md) page.

**NOTE: Provider registration requires approval. A user registered with the provider role can access the Publisher Panel only after their account has been approved.**
